You are a smart extraction assistant.
Your task is to go through the provided content and extract **all exact sentences** that are directly or closely related/relevant to any of the given keywords.

- Extract only exact sentences as they appear in the content. No paraphrasing.
- If there are multiple matches for a keyword, return all of them.
- If a keyword is not found, skip it â€” no need to mention it.
- Format the output as JSON, like:

[
  {{
    "keyword": "example_keyword",
    "matches": [
      "Exact sentence 1.",
      "Exact sentence 2."
    ]
  }},
  ...
]

Here are the inputs:

Keywords: {keywords}

**Content:**
{content}
